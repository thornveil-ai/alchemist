# Alchemist Production Readiness Report

**Date**: 2026-04-14
**Status**: Research prototype with proven methodology, NOT production-ready

## Executive Summary

Alchemist successfully translated zlib (23,139 lines C → 2,512 lines Rust) with **0 unsafe blocks across 7 compiling crates**. Differential testing against C zlib then revealed that **most of the generated code is functionally non-operational** — it compiles cleanly but doesn't actually do what the C code does.

This report catalogs every bug found, defines what Alchemist needs to be a turnkey C-to-Rust system, and prioritizes the work to get there.

---

## What worked

- **Stages 1-3 produce high-quality output**: tree-sitter analysis, per-function spec extraction, architecture design with proper crate boundaries
- **Stage 4 produces compilable output**: After Phase 1 fixes (scrubber, holistic fixer, validator), 7/7 crates compile with 0 unsafe
- **Adler-32**: After fixing wrong constants, **bit-exact match with C zlib across 30,000+ random byte arrays**
- **The methodology is sound**: algorithm-first translation produces 9.2× LOC compression and clean idiomatic code
- **Local-only inference works**: Gemma 4 31B Dense at your-llm-host:8090, zero cloud cost

## What's broken (verification findings)

### Bug Class 1: Wrong constants (silent semantic errors)

**Adler-32 used BASE=255 instead of 65521.** RFC 1950 mandates 65521 (largest prime less than 2^16). The model invented constants. Spec extraction CORRECTLY identified this as RFC 1950 — Stage 4 ignored the spec.

- Found by: differential test producing different checksums
- Fix complexity: trivial (one regex)
- Severity: **CRITICAL** — would have shipped wrong cryptography

### Bug Class 2: Stub/scaffolding without real implementation

**The `compress()` function returns Ok with a zero-filled output buffer.** No DEFLATE algorithm exists. Source code literally contains comments like `// Since we don't have the actual algorithm, we use a simple heuristic` and `// for this spec, we'll assume the compression is successful`.

Found in:
- `zlib-compression/src/compress.rs` — 11 instances of "we don't have", "simulate", "for this spec"
- `zlib-compression/src/uncompr.rs` — same pattern
- `zlib-io/src/deflate.rs` — 3 `unimplemented!()` calls

The model recognized it didn't know how to implement DEFLATE/inflate but wrote stubs that compile rather than failing loudly.

- Found by: compress→uncompress roundtrip failing at C-side decompress with Z_DATA_ERROR (-3)
- Fix complexity: **HIGH** — needs real algorithm implementation
- Severity: **CRITICAL** — entire purpose of the library doesn't work

### Bug Class 3: Missing functions claimed by architecture

**No CRC-32 compute function exists in the generated Rust.** The "crc32" module in zlib-io contains only table-writing helpers (`write_crc32_table`, `byte_swap`). The actual `crc32(data: &[u8]) -> u32` doesn't exist anywhere.

Found via: searching for compute functions across all crates.
- Architecture said zlib-io would have CRC-32
- Spec extraction had `crc32_checksum` algorithm
- Implementation generated I/O helpers instead

- Fix complexity: HIGH — needs to detect and re-prompt for missing functions
- Severity: **HIGH** — algorithm declared by architecture but not implemented

### Bug Class 4: Type mismatches (z_stream vs inflate_state)

The model conflated `z_stream` (the public stream type) and `inflate_state` (internal state). Methods declared on one were called on the other. Required ~50 reactive field additions across multiple iterations.

- Found by: cargo check errors during fix loop
- Fix complexity: MEDIUM — needs upfront type schema
- Severity: MEDIUM — cascaded into many compile errors

## Verification findings summary

| Algorithm | Compiles | Mathematically Correct | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|-------|
| Adler-32 | ✅ | ✅ (after BASE fix) | 30K random inputs match C zlib exactly |
| CRC-32 | ✅ (helpers only) | ❌ | Compute function never generated |
| compress() | ✅ | ❌ | Returns zeros |
| uncompress() | ✅ | ❌ | Cannot decompress real DEFLATE |
| deflate (lib) | ✅ | ❌ | 18 stubs/unimplemented |
| inflate (lib) | ✅ | ❓ Untested | Likely broken given pattern |
| trees | ✅ | ❓ Untested | |
| zlib-types | ✅ | N/A | Just type defs |

**4/7 crates compile but are functionally broken.**
**1/7 crate (Adler-32) is correct after one constant fix.**
**3/7 crates (types, trees, basic structure) are at least structurally sound.**

## What Alchemist needs to be production-ready

### Tier 1: Mandatory for "anyone with C code can use" (estimated 6-10 weeks)

#### 1. Test-driven generation (Stage 4 must be TDD)

Currently: Stage 4 generates code → fix loop until it compiles.
Required: Stage 4 generates code → runs spec test_vectors → fix loop until tests pass.

**Implementation**:
- Every AlgorithmSpec must include test_vectors (already in schema)
- Stage 4 generates the test FIRST: `assert_eq!(adler32(b"Wikipedia"), 0x11e60398)`
- Generates the implementation
- Compiles and runs tests
- If tests fail, iterates with `cargo test` errors as feedback (not just `cargo check`)
- Refuses to mark crate "complete" until tests pass

This catches Bug Class 1 (wrong constants) at generation time. The Adler-32 BASE bug would have failed iteration 1 instead of needing manual diff testing.

#### 2. Anti-stub detection

Current scrubber catches typos. New scrubber must catch generation lies:
- `unimplemented!()` in non-test code → **REJECT GENERATION**
- `todo!()` in production code → REJECT
- Comments matching `we don't have | for this spec | conceptually | simulate` → REJECT
- Functions that take input but never use it (just return Ok) → REJECT
- Output buffers that are never written → REJECT

When detected: re-prompt with explicit instruction "implement the actual algorithm, do not stub or simulate".

#### 3. Public API completeness check

Each spec lists `source_functions: [adler32, adler32_combine]`. After Stage 4:
- Walk every source_function
- Verify a corresponding pub fn exists
- If not, RE-PROMPT for missing function with full spec context

This catches Bug Class 3 (CRC-32 missing).

#### 4. Mandatory differential testing in Stage 5

Current Stage 5 is a stub. Must become:
- Auto-generate FFI bindings for every C public function
- Auto-generate proptest harness for each
- Run 10K+ random inputs through both implementations
- Report exact matches, ULP tolerance for floats, roundtrip equivalence for compression
- **REFUSE to declare success without passing differential tests**

#### 5. Spec test-vector requirement

Stage 2 currently allows specs without test_vectors. New requirement:
- Every AlgorithmSpec MUST have ≥1 test_vector
- For algorithms referencing standards (RFC, FIPS, NIST), MUST extract test vectors from the standard
- Re-prompt extraction if missing

### Tier 2: High-value for reliability (estimated 4-6 weeks)

#### 6. Compile-driven skeleton (Phase 2 plan)

Before generating bodies, generate just types + signatures + `unimplemented!()` bodies. Verify whole workspace compiles. Only then fill bodies. Catches type-system errors (Bug Class 4) before they cascade.

#### 7. Field schema pre-scan

Already built in `architect/field_scanner.py`. Wire into pipeline so types are generated complete on first pass.

#### 8. Spec validation by second model

Have a second LLM call review each spec extraction:
- Are the constants plausible? (BASE=255 is wrong for Adler-32; reviewer would flag)
- Are the test vectors mathematically consistent?
- Cross-reference cited standards

#### 9. Context-aware fix loop

Current fix loop sees `cargo check` errors. Enhanced version sees:
- The original spec
- Cited standards (link to RFC text)
- Test vectors from the standard
- Adjacent files in the crate

When fix attempt fails, retry with HEAVIER context (full spec + standard text), then escalate to a stronger model.

### Tier 3: Polish for usability (estimated 2-4 weeks)

#### 10. Productionize CLI

Wire the validator, field scanner, holistic fixer into `alchemist translate`. Currently they're standalone scripts. Should be: `alchemist translate ./mbedtls/` and have it just work.

#### 11. Multi-codebase validation

Run on:
- mbedTLS (crypto, NIST CAVP test vectors)
- lwIP (TCP/IP, can compare against smoltcp)
- FreeRTOS (RTOS kernel)
- SQLite (boss fight)

Each surfaces new failure classes. Each becomes a generic fix.

#### 12. Plugin architecture

Domain-specific extension points:
- Crypto plugin (auto-imports test vectors, knows constant-time requirements)
- RTOS plugin (handles interrupt contexts, no_std requirements)
- Networking plugin (packet handling patterns)

## Estimated effort to "anyone can use it"

| Phase | Work | Time | Reliability after |
|-------|------|------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 (done) | Validator, scrubber, holistic fix | ✅ Done | ~57% crates compile |
| Phase 2 | TDD Stage 4, anti-stub, API completeness | 6-10 weeks | ~70% crates compile + correct on simple algos |
| Phase 3 | Skeleton stage, spec validation, context fix | 4-6 weeks | ~85% on standard codebases |
| Phase 4 | Multi-codebase, plugins, productionize | 4-6 weeks | Reliable for common library types |
| Phase 5 | Hard targets (kernels, drivers, generics) | 12+ weeks | Honest 50-70% on arbitrary C |

**Total: 6-9 months of focused work to reach "anyone with normal C code gets working Rust"**

For exotic C (embedded with hand-written assembly, kernel drivers, OS code), expect to never hit 100%. Those need human input on architecture.

---

## Honest current capability

If you handed Alchemist (today) to a developer and asked "translate my C library":

| C codebase profile | Current likely outcome |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Pure stateless algorithm (single function) | High chance of compiling AND being correct |
| Algorithm library with state (zlib pattern) | Will compile, ~30-50% of functions actually work |
| Crypto library with test vectors | Will compile, semantic correctness unknown |
| Networking stack | Will compile, packet handling broken |
| Embedded RTOS | Will compile, scheduling probably non-functional |
| Kernel module | May not compile, definitely incorrect |

**Current Alchemist is a powerful research tool that proves the algorithm-first methodology works.** It's not yet a tool you'd hand to a stranger and trust the output without verification.

The PATH to that trustworthy state is clear (Tier 1 work), but it's months of work, not days.

---

## Immediate next steps (priority order)

1. **Build TDD Stage 4** (Tier 1.1) — biggest leverage, prevents most bug classes
2. **Add anti-stub scrubber rules** (Tier 1.2) — quick win, prevents silent failures
3. **Wire differential testing into pipeline** (Tier 1.4) — automates what we did manually today
4. **Apply lessons to mbedTLS** (Tier 3.11) — proves generalization

Each surfaces new requirements. Iterate.

---

## What this report proves

The verification step did its job. Without it, we would have shipped:
- Cryptographically wrong checksums
- A "compress" function that returns zeros
- A "decompress" function that cannot decompress
- A workspace that compiles but is functionally non-operational

The methodology (algorithm-first, per-file gen, scrubber, holistic fix) is real. The remaining work to make Alchemist production-grade is engineering, not research.
