"""Post-architect trait extractor.

Scans algorithm specs across the workspace and proposes TraitSpec entries
for every family of functions with compatible signatures. Runs as a
post-processing step between the architect's LLM output and the Stage 4
skeleton emission.

The architect's prompt already asks for traits, but the LLM often misses
obvious groupings (Adler32 + CRC32 → Checksum). This module is the
deterministic backstop that fills the gap, guaranteeing that compatible-
signature families always get a shared trait.

Heuristic: two functions share a "shape" if they have the same return
type and the same sequence of parameter Rust types. Functions with
identical shapes in the same domain category form a trait family.
